 For Standard Precision (SP) and HTVS Glide, GlideScore (GScore) is given by:

 GScore = a * vdW + b * Coul + Lipo + Hbond + Metal + Rewards + RotB + Site,

 where 

    vdW     = van der Waals interaction energy
    Coul    = Coulomb interaction energy
    Lipo    = Lipophilic-contact plus phobic-attractive term
    HBond   = Hydrogen-bonding term
    Metal   = Metal-binding term (usually a reward)
    Rewards = Various reward or penalty terms
    RotB    = Penalty for freezing rotatable bonds
    Site    = Polar interactions in the active site,

 and the coefficients of vdW and Coul are:

    a = 0.050, b = 0.150 for Glide 5.0
        (the contribution from the Coulomb term is capped at -4 kcal/mol)
    a = 0.063, b = 0.120 for Glide 4.5
        (the contribution from the Coulomb term is capped at -4 kcal/mol)
    a = 0.080, b = 0.100 for Glide 4.0


 (GScore = 10000.0 indicates that a given ligand pose failed one
 or more criteria for computing GScore.  Depending on which ones
 it failed, the components of GScore may not be valid either.)

 CvdW = Coul + vdW is the non-bonded interaction energy between
 the ligand and the receptor.
 Emodel is a specific combination of GScore, CvdW, and Intern,
 the estimated conformational energy of the ligand.
